RNN_LSTM
This is a Jupyter notebook that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells to predict sales. The data used for the prediction is the daily sales of a retail store for the past year.

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

Importing the libraries and data
Preparing the data
Building the RNN model
Training the model
Predicting sales
Evaluating the model
The notebook also includes a section on how to run the code.

Requirements
Python 3.6+
NumPy
Pandas
Keras
Tensorflow
Usage
To run the code, you will need to install the required libraries. Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the notebook by opening it in a Jupyter notebook environment.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.

# Conda environment with environment.yml

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/conda_environment/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

A Binder-compatible repo with an `environment.yml` file.

Access this Binder by clicking the blue badge above or at the following URL:

http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/conda_environment/master?filepath=index.ipynb

## Notes
The `environment.yml` file should list all Python libraries on which your notebooks
depend, specified as though they were created using the following `conda` commands:

```
conda activate example-environment
conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml
```

Note that the only libraries available to you will be the ones specified in
the `environment.yml`, so be sure to include everything that you need! 

Also note that if you skip the `--from-history`, conda may include OS-specific
packages in `environment.yml`, which you would have to manually prune from
`environment.yml`.  For example, confirmed macOS-specific packages that should
be removed are:

* libcxxabi=4.0.1
* appnope=0.1.0
* libgfortran=3.0.1
* libcxx=4.0.1
